title: JWT Jedi Master
subtitle: "Secure user authentication: Master JWT and apply it to Anythink"
description: In the quest ahead, you'll dive deeper into JWT. 
  You'll decode JWTs from user sessions, manage their expiration, 
  handle request redirection on their expiration, and modify user flows based on JWT's authorization status.
summary: Great job! In this quest, you learned about JWT and how to implement
  JWT-based authentication in the Anythink app. You now understand the benefits
  of using JWT, the structure of a token, and best practices for token
  management. You also learned to securely store and transmit JWTs between the
  front end and back end.
